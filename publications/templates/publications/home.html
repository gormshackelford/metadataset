<h1>Dynamic meta-analysis</h1>
<p>
  Metadataset is a collection of open data from scientific publications. These
  publications are about the management of agricultural and natural resources
  (e.g., crops, soil, water, and wildlife). The data are extracted from
  scientific publications, standardized, and summarized using
  <a href="{% url 'about' %}">dynamic meta-analysis</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This is <span class="red">work in progress</span>. Please contact us if you
  would like to get access to the data while this is still a work in progress.
