<h1>Dynamic meta-analysis</h1>
<p>
  How should evidence be used to make decisions, if the evidence is synthesized
  at a global scale, across many different contexts, but the decisions are made
  at a local scale, in a context that differs from the global average?
</p>
<p>
  Metadataset enables users to interact with a global evidence base, to find
  evidence that is relevant to their decisions. As well as browsing our evidence
  maps to find publications on a specific intervention, outcome, or country,
  you can also try a new method of interactive evidence synthesis that we call
  "dynamic meta-analysis".

<p>
  Dynamic meta-analysis is our method of improving the transferability of
  evidence from a global meta-analysis to a local decision. Metadataset provides
  two options for dynamic meta-analysis:
  <ul>
    <li>
      (1) filtering, in which studies can be excluded from a meta-analysis if
      they are not relevant to that context ("subgroup analysis" and
      "meta-regression"), and
    </li>
    <li>
      (2) weighting, in which studies can be given a lower weight if they are
      less relevant to that context ("recalibration").
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
