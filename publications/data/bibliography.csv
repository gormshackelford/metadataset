In this research were assessed the effects of maize hybrids (AG 1051 and BR 205) in an intercropping with Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and mechanical hoeing on weed control. The treatments assessed were: A - maize monocropping + two hoeings (20 and 40 days after sowing); B - maize with one hoeing at 20 days + intercropping with gliricidia sowed after hoeing; C - maize sowing intercropped with gliricidia at the time of maize sowing + hoeing at 40 days; D - maize sowing intercropped with gliricidia at the time of maize sowing without hoeing; E - monocropping maize without hoeing. In the intercroppings, gliricidia was sowed in broadcast seeding with 30 viable seeds m(-2). Maize hybrids did not differ in their effects on weed growth and grain yield. Treatments A, B and C have reduced weed growth, compared to treatments D and E. The highest grain yield was obtained with treatment A and the lowest with treatment E.

Uncontrolled weed growth caused 40% reduction in root yield of short, profusely branching cassava cultivar while a 68% reduction in root yield was observed in separate studies involving a tall non-branching cultivar. Two or three properly timed hoe weedings gave crop yields that were as good as keeping the plots weed free throughout the growing season. Although pre-emergence application of fluometuron at 2.0 to 3.0 kg a.i./ha or diuron at 2.0 kg a.i./ha used singly gave good weed control and crop yield, the efficacy of these herbicides was greatly improved by tank mixing each of them with alachlor or metolachlor at 3.0 and 2.0 kg a.i./ha respectively. Excellent crop yield was also observed where atrazine and metolachlor was applied pre-emergence at 2.5 kg a.i./ha.

The potential of intercroppingmaize (Zea mays) or sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) with watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) was tested in two on-farm trials in southern Mozambique under semi-arid conditions in an area with low and unpredictable rainfall. In the first experiment, plant density, yield and monetary value of sole and intercropping plots of maize with watermelon were determined in 17 farmers' fields in an area where all crops developed to maturity and harvest. There was a significant reduction in yield of both maize (28.8%) and watermelon (57.8%) in the intercrop compared with the sole crop yields. However, the mean land equivalent ratio of 1.13 for yield showed that intercropping had advantages as, on average, an area planted with sole crops would require 13% more land than an intercrop production to generate the same outcome. In the second experiment, carried out in another area with 16 farmers' fields, drought was more pronounced and only watermelon developed to maturity.

The aim was to compare the water-ex tract ab le DM of these feeds with NDF values as predictors of whole tract DM digestibility. The proportion of leaf in the foliages offered was highest in cassava with relatively lower values for stylo and water spinach which were similar to each other (only leaves were fed in the case of guinea grass). Some degree of selection occurred during eating as there were indications that on the cassava the goats selected the same proportion of leaf as in the foliage offered, but ate more of the petioles than the stems. For stylo, leaves were preferred slightly more than stems while the opposite was the case with the water spinach. There was a close relationship between water-ex tractable DM and NDF in DM (R2 = 0.77; n = 35) in the different botanical components of the four foliages. DM intakes were highest on guinea grass and lowest on cassava with intermediate values for stylo and water spinach. Highest DM digestibility was recorded on the water spinach diet with lowest values for cassava. N digestibility was also high for water spinach with the lowest value for guinea grass. Among the guinea grass, stylo and water spinach foliages, there was a close relationships between DM digestibility and the two chosen indicators:- NDF and water extractable DM , with the closest fit being observed for the latter (R2 = 0.85 and 0.98, respectively; n=3). The data for cassava did not fit in either of these relationships.

It serves as the primary source of carbohydrate for the world population in developing countries. Sweet potato has been reported as drought sensitive, especially in the rain fed region with extended drought condition. Some cultivars might be more tolerant to drought stress compared to others. We investigated the physiological and morphological responses and storage root yield attributes of 6 sweet potato genotypes (cvs. Manphuang and Mankorat, PROC 65-3, Banyang 9, Tainung 57 and Japanese yellow) to water deficit stress (15% SWC) with an aim to classify the water deficit tolerance using the relationship between free proline and osmotic adjustments. Osmotic potential (Ψs), chlorophyll b (Chlb), maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm), plant height and number of leaves in sweet potato cv. PROC 65-3 grown under water deficit condition (15% SWC) were better than those in other cultivars. The yield reduction, growth inhibition, free proline enrichment, osmotic potential maintaining, chlorophyll degradation, chlorophyll fluorescence diminution, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E) reduction in water deficit stressed plants were subjected to Ward's cluster analysis. Mankorat, PROC 65-3 and Japanese Yellow were classified as water deficit tolerance whereas Manphuang, Banyang 9 and Tainung 57 genotypes were evaluated as water deficit sensitive.

The paper assesses the impact of the domestic production of 5 per cent ethanol (E5) needed under the Nigerian biofuel programme from cassava root on the water resource of Nigeria. Using the 2007 Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) consumption as the baseline, Nigeria will require about 0.49 hm3 of ethanol to blend 9.32 hm3 of PMS to arrive at the 2007 consumption estimates. The impact of the domestic production of this ethanol requirement translates to about 6.0 km3 of water; out of which about 48 per cent is green and about 52 per cent is blue. Addressing future impact typical of a developing economy like Nigeria, a three-scenario analysis was adopted to examine the impact of future growth in cassava-fuel ethanol requirement on the water resource of Nigeria, and also, the impact of improved water use on the future water footprint of E5. The projected water impact of cassava-ethanol production into the future ranges from 6.02 to 7.28 km3, while improved water use could lower these values by about 0.04-2.35 km3 for the same period, 2010 to 2020, under the projection assumptions made. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2010,985-992,7,34,,2009,"Olanrewaju, O O; Olufayo, A A; Oguntunde, P G; Ilemobade, A A",Water use efficiency of Manihot Esculenta Crantz under drip irrigation system in South Western Nigeria,European Journal of Scientific Research,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-65349196342&partnerID=40&md5=e75516513f7a7f430ff017f14fafe546,"Field experiments was conducted at Teaching and Research Farm, Federal University of Technology, Akure between November 2006 and November 2007 to find out the water use efficiency under drip irrigation system and effect on the growth and yield of Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). A popular hybrid of cassava TMS 30572 was tried as a test crop. The soil of the experimental site was moderately drained, loamy sand. The experiments were laid out in a 4 × 4 × 2 randomised complete block design (RCBD) consisting of 4 treatments, 4 replicates and 2 varieties using a spacing of (1m × 0.8m) for mechanical harvesting. The results indicated that the highest moisture content was recorded at depth of 40cm during the late stage of tuber development and the highest biomass yield was recorded under full irrigation treatment than in other treatments. The yield of cassava ranged from 21.87 to 14.13 t ha-1 in all the treatments except for the control that has 8.45 t ha-1 while the water use efficiency ranged from 19.18 to 23.63 kg ha-1mm. Irrigation through full treatment registered the highest mean tuber yield of 21.87 t ha-1 while the least tuber yield was associated with the control treatment. The height and stem diameter of cassava also responded higher under full treatment of available water.

Water stress induced by polyethylene glycol (MW 6000, osmotic potential — 1.65 MPa) caused a ca 25‐fold increase in proline in young excised leaves of the susceptible cultivar (M‐4) while the increase was about 9‐fold in the tolerant cultivar (S‐1315). The activity of ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of proline, was found to increase 3‐fold in water stressed leaves of M‐4 and about 2‐fold in those of S‐1315. The activity of proline oxidase, which is involved in the degradation of proline to pyrroline‐5‐carboxylate, was reduced by 50% in M‐4 and nearly 25% in S‐1315 on water stress. Comparison of the kinetic properties of OAT showed that the enzyme from water‐stressed leaves is more stable to heat inactivation compared to that of control. These results indicate that during water stress there are alterations in the metabolism of proline in cassava, and the extent of alteration varies between drought‐susceptible and ‐tolerant cultivars.

The kinetics was studied using Voigt-based viscoelastic model to determine the rate parameter and the swelling rate (SR). It was noted that under all conditions, the water sorption followed a second order kinetics. The absorbency was directly proportional to the rate of swelling. But when the sample was allowed to swell in aqueous solutions of CaCl2 and AlCl3, the absorbency as well as the SR was irregular. The particle size also had significant effect on water absorption by the SAP and the polymer with smaller particles showed more absorption than those with larger particle size.

In semi-arid areas production of maize is constrained by droughts and poor rainfall distribution. The best way to grow crops in these areas is through irrigation, but limited areal extent, increasing water scarcity, and prohibitive development costs limit the feasibility of irrigation. Therefore, there is need for a policy shift towards other viable options. This paper presents daily rainfall analysis from Rushinga district, a semi-arid location in Northern Zimbabwe. The purpose of the rainfall analysis was to assess opportunities and limitations for rainfed maize production using 25 years of data. Data was analysed using a variety of statistical methods that include trend analysis, t-test for independent samples, rank-based frequency analysis, Spearman's correlation coefficient and Mann-Whitney's U test. The results showed no evidence of change in rainfall pattern. The mean seasonal rainfall was 631. mm with a standard deviation (SD) of 175. mm. December, January and February consistently remained the major rainfall months. The results depicted high inter-annual variability for both annual and seasonal rainfall totals, a high incidence of droughts ≥3 out of every 10 years and ≥1 wet year in 10 years. Using the planting criteria recommended in Zimbabwe, most of the plantings would occur from the third decade of November with the mode being the first decade of December. This predisposes the rainfall to high evaporation and runoff losses especially in December when the crop is still in its initial stage of growth. On average 5 to more than 20 days dry spells occupy 56% of the rainy season. Seasonal rainfall exhibited negative correlation (P< 0.001; R=-0.746) with cumulative dry spell length, and wet years were free from dry spells exceeding 20 days. The most common dry spells (6-10 days), are in the range in which irrigated crops survive on available soil water. Therefore, they can be mitigated by in situ rainwater harvesting (RWH) and water conservation. The potential evapotranspiration of a 140-day maize crop was estimated to be 540. mm. Consequently, short season maize cultivars that mature in less than 140 days could be grown successfully in this area in all but drought years. However, sustainable maize production can only be achieved with careful management of the soil as a medium for storing water, which is essential for buffering against dry spells. To this end soil restorative farming systems are recommended such as conservation farming, in situ RWH techniques for dry spell mitigation and a cropping system that includes drought-tolerant cereal crops as for example sorghum and pearl millet, and perennial carbohydrate sources as for example cassava to provide stable crop yields. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011,1649-1659,10,98,,2010,"Lopes, A C; Viana, A E S; Matsomoto, S N; Cardoso Júnior, N S; São José, A R","Water management and harvest time on cassava cv coqueiro in Planalto de Conquista, BA",Ciencia e Agrotecnologia,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77953500286&partnerID=40&md5=133cfc5d754375024c3f8b3568d6619d,"In order to assess the effect of irrigation and harvest time on productivity and other agronomical characteristics of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) known as Coqueiro, one experiment was developed under conditions of dry land and irrigation.

This chapter reviews studies on the water footprints (WFs) of bioenergy (in the form of bioethanol, biodiesel, and heat and electricity produced from biomass) and compares their results with the WFs of fossil energy and other types of renewables (wind power, solar thermal energy, and hydropower). WFs for bioenergy vary, depending on crop type applied, production location, and agricultural practice. The most water-efficient way to generate bioenergy is to use biomass for heat generation, with electricity generation being the second best option. Biofuel production requires roughly twice as much water as bioelectricity. Regarding biofuels, bioethanol has smaller WFs than biodiesel. For example, the WF of rapeseed biodiesel is four times larger than the WF of sugarcane ethanol and seven times larger than the WF of sugar beet ethanol. Global weighted ethanol WFs increase in the order of sugar beet, potato, sugarcane, maize, cassava, barley, rye, paddy rice, wheat, and sorghum and range between 60 and 400 m3/GJ. For sugar beet, maize, and sugarcane, differences between regions are large. The European Union, northern Africa, and the United States have relatively small WFs for ethanol from sugar beet and maize, while eastern Europe has large WFs. Global weighted average biodiesel WFs increase in the following order: palm oil (95 m3/GJ), soybean and rapeseed (400 m3/GJ), and jatropha (570 m3/GJ). Conversely, the WFs of fossil fuels are relatively small. Finally, the WF of hydropower varies widely between 0.5 and 850 m3/GJ.

Replacing transport fuels with bioethanol will require substantial amounts of water and enhance water competition locally. This study shows that the water footprint (WF) of molasses-based ethanol is less than that of cassava-based ethanol. The WF of molasses-based ethanol is estimated to be in the range of 1,510-1,990 L water/L ethanol, while that of cassava-based ethanol is estimated at 2,300-2,820 L water/L ethanol. Approximately 99% of the water in each of these WFs is used to cultivate crops. Ethanol production requires not only substantial amounts of water but also government interventions because it is not cost competitive. In Thailand, the government has exploited several strategies to lower ethanol prices such as oil tax exemptions for consumers, cost compensation for ethanol producers, and crop price assurances for farmers. For the renewable energy policy to succeed in the long run, the government may want to consider promoting molasses-based ethanol production as well as irrigation system improvements and sugarcane yield-enhancing practices, since molasses-based ethanol is more favorable than cassava-based ethanol in terms of its water consumption, chemical fertilizer use, and production costs. © 2013 International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.",2013,273-282,4,22,,2014,"Gheewala, S H; Silalertruksa, T; Nilsalab, P; Mungkung, R; Perret, S R; Chaiyawannakarn, N","Water footprint and impact of water consumption for food, feed, fuel crops production in Thailand",Water (Switzerland),10.3390/w6061698,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902662869&doi=10.3390%2Fw6061698&partnerID=40&md5=abbaaba7d662bac1e3c48a204e501d2d,"The proliferation of food, feed and biofuels demands promises to increase pressure on water competition and stress, particularly for Thailand, which has a large agricultural base. This study assesses the water footprint of ten staple crops grown in different regions across the country and evaluates the impact of crop water use in different regions/watersheds by the water stress index and the indication of water deprivation potential. The ten crops include major rice, second rice, maize, soybean, mungbean, peanut, cassava, sugarcane, pineapple and oil palm. The water stress index of the 25 major watersheds in Thailand has been evaluated. The results show that there are high variations of crop water requirements grown in different regions due to many factors. However, based on the current cropping systems, the Northeastern region has the highest water requirement for both green water (or rain water) and blue water (or irrigation water). Rice (paddy) farming requires the highest amount of irrigation water, i.e., around 10,489 million m3/year followed by the maize, sugarcane, oil palm and cassava. Major rice cultivation induces the highest water deprivation, i.e., 1862 million m3H2Oeq/year; followed by sugarcane, second rice and cassava. The watersheds that have high risk on water competition due to increase in production of the ten crops considered are the Mun, Chi and Chao Phraya watersheds. The main contribution is from the second rice cultivation.

Divided into five parts, the chapter covers topics on cassava processing, the characteristics of waste from cassava, the impact of cassava waste on the environment, the potential industrial processes for wastewater conversion and the bioproducts from microalgae, summarizing a range of useful techno-economic opportunities to be applied on cassava processing plants. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",2017,149-170,,,,"Department of Food Science and Technology, Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, RS, Brazil"2003,"Iyayi, E A",Wastes to wealth: Improvement of agro-industrial by-products through fungal biotechnology,,,,"The Nigerian livestock feed industry competes with other sectors for the consumption of conventional ingredients. This competition often pushes the prices of finished feed upwards. A redirection of efforts to the use of agro-byproducts has been advocated as a way of solving this problem. This study with some ago-byproducts was carried out to provide information on the use of these by-products. Changes in the nutrient compositions of some selected agro industrial by-products on biodegradation with Trichoderma viride and their feeding value as an energy source for layers were investigated. By-products studied were brewer's dried grains (BDG), rice bran (RB), palm kernel meal (PKM) and corn bran (CB). The protein in BDG, RB, PKM and CB increased by 87, 68, 32 and 61% when they were fermented with the fungi for 14 days. At the same time, the fiber in the by-products decreased by 35.00, 40.00, 36.50 and 37.50%, respectively with a corresponding increase of 49.00, 37.00, 9.00 and 5.50% in the level of soluble sugars respectively. The energy in the biodegraded by-products increased by 6.30, 5.00, 9.00 and 18.50%, respectively. In a feeding trial with layers, 50% of the maize in a standard commercial diet was replaced with biodegraded BDG, RB and PKM. Birds on the BDG and RB diets had significantly (P<0.05) higher hen day production than those on the other diets. Diets in which the biodegraded by-products replaced maize produced lower cost of egg production than the standard commercial diet. Of the test diets, BDG gave the lowest cost of US$0.38 per tray of eggs (30 eggs) compared with US$0.53 for the commercial diet. Results of the study showed that fungal biodegradation of the agro industrial by-products can enhance their nutritional status. Using such by-products to feed layers spared half of the maize in the diet and produce better laying performance.",2003,,,,,2017,"Johnravindar, D; Murugesan, K; Wong, J W C; Elangovan, N",Waste-to-biofuel: production of biobutanol from sago waste residues,Environmental Technology (United Kingdom),10.1080/09593330.2017.1283362,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013223057&doi=10.1080%2F09593330.2017.1283362&partnerID=40&md5=2c5813b76ae026d1a669f0eb3e5034e6,"The main concern of extensive production of biobutanol has been associated with the high cost of the substrate and the relatively low tolerance of Clostridia to biobutanol production.

Four of obligatory, solvent-producing bacteria were isolated from sago industry waste sites. The NSW, PNAS1, SB5 and SBI4 strains showed identical profiles of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of Bacillus coagulans, Clostridium bifermentans and Clostridium sp.

A summary of available researches has been composed by a wide range of potentially low-cost modified adsorbents including activated carbon, natural source adsorbents (clay, bentonite, zeolite, etc.), biosorbents (black gram husk, sugar-beet pectin gels, citrus peels, banana and orange peels, carrot residues, cassava waste, algae, algal, marine green macroalgae, etc.), and byproduct adsorbents (sawdust, lignin, rice husk, rice husk ash, coal fly ash, etc.). From the literature survey, different adsorbents were compared in terms of Zn 2+ adsorption capacity; also Zn2+ adsorption capacity was compared with other metals adsorption. Thus, some of the highest adsorption capacities reported for Zn2+ are 168 mg/g powdered waste sludge, 128.8 mg/g dried marine green macroalgae, 73.2 mg/g lignin, 55.82 mg/g cassava waste, and 52.91 mg/g bentonite. Furthermore, modification of adsorbents can improve adsorption capacity. Regeneration cost is important, but if consumption of virgin adsorbent is reduced, then multiple economic, industrial, and environmental benefits can be gained. Finally, the main drawback of the already published Zn2+ adsorption researches is that their use is still in the laboratory stage mostly without scale-up, pilot studies, or commercialization. © 2014 Haider M.

Tests using experimental barns in Ghana and Tanzania and direct observations of farm stores in Ghana have shown that the incidence of infestation in stores is related to the numbers of beetles in the process of dispersal by flight. It has been possible to define curves relating the probability of infestation in stores to the cumulative catch of flying P. truncatus over the course of a storage season, although other factors such as previous infestation of stores can also be significant. In these experimental studies, dispersal by flight has been estimated using pheromone traps. However, the use of pheromone traps on a large scale to gather dispersal data is expensive and time consuming and in the long term is unlikely to be sustainable.

Hexanal was the most abundant compound in the corn and potato starches and in the laboratory-prepared wheat starch as determined by total ion chromatogram (TIC) peak areas. Hexanal was the third most abundant compound in commercial wheat starch after 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and benzaldehyde. Among the volatile organics, the level of aldehydes was the highest, followed by alcohols, ketones, benzenes, esters, and terpenes. Specific compounds identified, the majority of which appear to be degradation products of lipid peroxidation, include hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, benzaldehyde, 2- propanone, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, methylbenzene, and tetradecane. Waxy corn starch, which released a substantially higher level of total volatiles than all other starches, contained large amounts of pentyl, 2-methyl-1-butyl, benzyl, and isobornyl acetates, and citronella and 1,8- cineole. Tapioca starch contained few volatiles but did contain an increased level of 2-propanol. No alcohols occurred in the commercial corn starch.

Vitrification refers to the physical process by which a highly concentrated cryoprotective solution supercools to very low temperatures and finally solidifies into a metastable glass, without undergoing crystallization at a practical cooling rate. Samples are thus cryopreserved without detrimental intracellular ice formation. In a standard vitrification protocol, excised explants are precultured on medium enriched with sucrose, treated ('loaded') with a loading solution composed of 2 M glycerol + 0.4 M sucrose, dehydrated with a highly concentrated vitrification solution [e.g. the PVS2 vitrification solution, which contains 30% (w/v) glycerol, 15% (w/v) ethylene, glycol and 15% (w/v) DMSO and 0.4 M sucrose], frozen and rewarmed rapidly, unloaded with basal culture medium supplemented with 1.2 M sucrose, and then transferred to standard culture conditions. In the encapsulation-vitrification technique, the explants are encapsulated in alginate beads, loaded and dehydrated with a vitrification solution before rapid immersion in liquid nitrogen. In the droplet-freezing technique, excised explants are loaded, treated with the vitrification solution and frozen in individual microdroplets of vitrification solution placed on aluminium foils, which are immersed rapidly in liquid nitrogen. These three techniques have been applied to different tissues of over 100 plant species from temperate and tropical origins and the number of cases where they are being tested on a large scale or applied routinely is increasing.",2007,151-172,3,28,,2017,"Mangel, Nathalie; Fudge, Jared B; Fitzpatrick, Teresa B; Gruissem, Wilhelm; Vanderschuren, Herve",Vitamin B-1 diversity and characterization of biosynthesis genes in cassava,Journal of Experimental Botany,10.1093/jxb/erx196,,"Vitamin B-1, which consists of the vitamers thiamin and its phosphorylated derivatives, is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms because it is required as a metabolic cofactor in several enzymatic reactions. Genetic diversity of vitamin B-1 biosynthesis and accumulation has not been investigated in major crop species other than rice and potato. We analyzed cassava germplasm for accumulation of B-1 vitamers. Vitamin B-1 content in leaves and roots of 41 cassava accessions showed significant variation between accessions. HPLC analyses of B-1 vitamers revealed distinct profiles in cassava leaves and storage roots, with nearly equal relative levels of thiamin pyrophosphate and thiamin monophosphate in leaves, but mostly thiamin pyrophosphate in storage roots. Unusually, the cassava genome has two genes encoding the 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate synthase, THIC (MeTHIC1 and MeTHIC2), both of which carry a riboswitch in the 3'-UTR, as well as the adenylated thiazole synthase, THI1 (MeTHI1a and MeTHI1b). The THIC and THI1 genes are expressed at very low levels in storage roots compared with the accumulation of vitamin B1, indicating only limited biosynthesis de novo therein.

This hampers our understanding of plant metabolism and dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) of tissue imprints on porous Teflon may be used to accurately image the distribution of even labile plant metabolites such as hydroxynitrile glucosides, which normally undergo enzymatic hydrolysis by specific β-glucosidases upon cell disruption. This fast and simple sample preparation resulted in no substantial differences in the distribution and ratios of all hydroxynitrile glucosides between leaves from wild-type Lotus japonicus and a β-glucosidase mutant plant that lacks the ability to hydrolyze certain hydroxynitrile glucosides. In wild-type, the enzymatic conversion of hydroxynitrile glucosides and the concomitant release of glucose were easily visualized when a restricted area of the leaf tissue was damaged prior to sample preparation. The gene encoding the first enzyme in hydroxynitrile glucoside biosynthesis in L. japonicus leaves, CYP79D3, was found to be highly expressed during the early stages of leaf development, and the hydroxynitrile glucoside distribution in mature leaves reflected this early expression pattern. The utility of direct DESI-MSI of plant tissue was demonstrated using cryo-sections of cassava (Manihot esculenta) tubers. The hydroxynitrile glucoside levels were highest in the outer cell layers, as verified by LC-MS analyses. The unexpected discovery of a hydroxynitrile-derived di-glycoside shows the potential of DESI-MSI to discover and guide investigations into new metabolic routes. © 2013 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2013,1059-1071,6,74,,2003,"Mwanza, J C; Lysebo, D E; Kayembe, D L; Tshala-Katumbay, D; Nyamabo, L K; Tylleskar, T; Plant, G T","Visual evoked potentials in konzo, a spastic paraparesis of acute onset in Africa",Ophthalmologica,10.1159/000073066,,"Aim: To assess whether or not visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are abnormal in konzo, a para/tetraparesis of sudden onset, and to correlate the findings to the clinical picture of the disorder. Methods: VEPs were recorded in 23 patients (9 men and 14 women, mean age: 23 B 10 years) suffering from konzo, and 38 healthy subjects (20 men and 18 women, mean age: 27 B 15 years). The mean P100 latencies and peak-to-peak N75-P100 amplitudes of each eye were measured and compared in the two groups. The mean interocular P100 latency and amplitude differences were calculated and also compared. Results: VEPs were abnormal in 11/23 patients (48%) consisting of P100 prolongation (7 subjects), absence of P100 wave (2 subjects) or an atypical waveform (2 subjects). The mean P100 latency value of the konzo group was significantly increased as compared with the mean (+ 2.5 SD) of the reference values from healthy subjects (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant decrease of amplitude in konzo patients compared to normal subjects (p < 0.05) with, however, only 2 patients outside the 95% confidence limits. Six patients (27%) had abnormal VEPs despite normal visual acuity. These abnormalities were symmetric and a relation could be found between neither the duration nor the severity of the disease and the VEP perturbation. Conclusion: The main features of these abnormalities are delayed P100 latency and decreased amplitude. These findings indicate involvement of visual pathways and seem to suggest the presence of axonal loss in the prechiasmal visual pathways in konzo. This study provides evidence that the neurodamage in konzo extends to the visual pathways. Copyright (C) 2003 S.

This technology employs a wet binder which provides to the excipient:drug mixture the proper binding characteristics to form granules able to be compressed into tablets. The aim of this study is to evaluate the viscosity, agglomeration behavior and tableting characteristics of cassava starch and to compare these properties to those of classic binders such as alginic acid, sodium alginate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and gum arabic at 5 and 10% levels using ibuprofen as a model drug. Viscosity profiles were determined on a Brookfield viscometer. Wet binders were added to the microcrystalline cellulose-ibuprofen (60:40) mixtures on a ribbon blender and then granules were formed on an oscillating granulator. Granules were then compressed on a single punch tablet machine. Results indicate that granule properties depended on the binder type, rather than on the binder level employed. Less plastic deforming materials such as alginic acid, gum arabic and PVP k30 rendered tablets with the best compactibility. However, no major differences were observed among the granule properties of cassava and corn starches. Gum arabic and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose produced the most viscous dispersions (>50000 mPas), which in turn, showed no relation with the strength of the compacts produced. The largest particle size was found for granules made with alginic acid and gum arabic (~290 μm), whereas for most granules it ranged from 100 to 150 μm. The true density of the granules produced ranged from 1.31 to 1.40 g/cm3. Granules having the largest size also presented the fastest flow rate (>16 g/s). Further, except for alginic acid, sodium alginate and cassava starch, bulk and tap densities ranged from 0.3 to 0.35 and 0.36 to 0.45 g/cm3, respectively. Moreover, alginic acid and gum arabic produced granules with the lowest porosity (<65%). Likewise, corn starch was the most compressible material (>33%), whereas, alginic acid and gum arabic rendered the least compressible granules.

In this study, viscosity reduction of cassava root mash, chips, and pulp was achieved using a mixture of cell wall degrading enzymes prepared from solid state fermentation of Aspergillus aculeatus BCC17849. Proteomic analysis showed the mixture contained endo- and exo-acting cellulases, hemicellulases, and pectinases from various glycosyl hydrolase families. Enzymatic pretreatment of cassava substrates with the enzyme mixture containing endoglucanase, FPase, xylanase, polygalacturonase, β-glucanase, and mannanase activities at 45 °C, pH 5.0 for 2 h reduced viscosity to the operating level of <500 mPa s, equivalent to the final viscosity of 3.0-51.3% of the initial levels. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of the pretreated root mash (32% initial solid) by Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a conventional high-temperature liquefaction process and an uncooked process using a raw starch degrading amylase at 32°C for 96 h led to a final ethanol concentration of 19.65 and 17.54% (v/v), respectively.

The influences of viscometer type and viscosity measurement conditions on gruels prepared with simple or multicomponent flours were assessed in this study. The results showed a drastic decrease in apparent viscosity when the shear rate increased. Other factors like shear time and gruel temperature also had a marked influence on apparent viscosity. For two types of gruel (maize or multicomponent flour) prepared at different concentrations, correspondences between a short qualitative description of the consistency and apparent viscosity values obtained with several viscometers in different measurement conditions are given.

The objective of this work was to study how the addition of different types of inulin (average long-chain, native and average short-chain inulin) at four concentrations (0%, 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% w/w) may affect the viscoelastic properties of semisolid dairy systems formulated with either skimmed or whole milk and two modified tapioca starch concentrations (3.25% or 4% w/w). The mechanical spectra obtained for most of the samples were typical of gelled materials. A significant effect of the interactions between the inulin type, the inulin concentration and the starch concentration on the storage and loss moduli (G′and G″), on the loss tangent angle (tan δ) and on the complex viscosity (η*) values at 1 Hz was observed in both whole- and skimmed-milk samples. The effect of the different types of inulin on the viscoelastic properties of the systems was dependent not only on the inulin concentration added to them but also on the sample composition.

Different viral pre-miRNA hairpin sequences and viral miR/miR*length variants occurring as isomiRs were predicted in both viruses. These miRNAs were located in three Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and in the Intergenic Region (IR). Moreover, various target genes for miRNAs from both viruses were predicted and annotated in the host plant genomes indicating that they are involved in biotic response, metabolic pathways and transcription factors. Plant miRs/miRs*from conserved and highly expressed families were identified, which were shown to have potential targets in the genome of both begomoviruses, representing potential plant miRNAs mediating antiviral defense. This is the first assessment of predicted viral miRs/miRs*of ACMV and EACMV-UG and host plant miRNAs, providing a reference point for miRNA identification in pathogens and their hosts.

A key feature to plant recovery from invading nucleic acids such as viruses is the degree of the host’s initial basal immunity response. We review current links between RNA silencing, recovery and tolerance, and present a model in which, in addition to regulation of resistance (R) and other defence-related genes by RNA silencing, viral infections incite perturbations of the host physiological state that trigger reprogramming of host responses to by-pass severe symptom development, leading to partial or complete recovery. Recovery, in particular in perennial hosts, may trigger tolerance or virus accommodation. We discuss evidence suggesting that plant viruses can avoid total clearance but persistently replicate at low levels, thereby modulating the host transcriptome response which minimizes fitness cost and triggers recovery from viral-symptoms. In some cases a susceptible host may fail to recover from initial viral systemic symptoms, yet, accommodates the persistent virus throughout the life span, a phenomenon herein referred to as non-recovery accommodation, which differs from tolerance in that there is no distinct recovery phase, and differs from susceptibility in that the host is not killed.

Brazil is the world leader in the production and export of various agricultural and livestock products. The country is either a strong net importer or a strong net exporter of these products. The objective of this study is to determine the volume of virtual water contained in agricultural and livestock products imported/exported by Brazil from 1997 to 2012, and to define the water self-sufficiency index of agricultural and livestock products in Brazil. The indexes of water scarcity (WSI), water dependency (WDI) and water self-sufficiency (WSSI) were calculated for each Brazilian state. These indexes and the virtual water balance were calculated following the methodology developed by Chapagain and Hoekstra (2008) and Hoekstra and Hung (2005). The total water exports and imports embedded in agricultural and livestock products were 5.28 × 1010 and 1.22 × 1010 Gm3 yr−1, respectively, which results in positive virtual water balance of 4.05 × 1010 Gm3 yr−1. Brazil is either a strong net importer or a strong net exporter of agricultural and livestock products among the Mercosur countries. Brazil has a positive virtual water balance of 1.85 × 1010 Gm3 yr−1. The indexes used in this study reveal that Brazil is self-sufficient in food production, except for a few products such as wheat and rice. Horticultural products (tomato, onion, potato, cassava and garlic) make up a unique product group with negative virtual water balance in Brazil. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2016,465-472,,184,,2009,"Caciagli, Piero; Medina Piles, Vicente; Marian, Daniele; Vecchiati, Manuela; Masenga, Vera; Mason, Giovanna; Falcioni, Tania; Noris, Emanuela","Virion Stability Is Important for the Circulative Transmission of Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Sardinia Virus by Bemisia tabaci, but Virion Access to Salivary Glands Does Not Guarantee Transmissibility",Journal of Virology,10.1128/JVI.02267-08,,"The capsid protein (CP) of the monopartite begomovirus Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV), family Geminiviridae, is indispensable for plant infection and vector transmission.

Two previously described mutants, one with a double Q129P Q134H mutation (PNHD) and another with a further D152E change (PNHE), were found nontransmissible (NT). Another NT mutant with a single N130D change (QDQD) was retrieved from a new mutational analysis. In this study, these three NT mutants and the wild-type (wt) virus were compared in their relationships with the whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci and the nonvector Trialeurodes vaporariorum. Retention kinetics of NT mutants were analyzed by quantitative dot blot hybridization in whiteflies fed on infected plants. The QDQD mutant, whose virions appeared nongeminate following purification, was hardly detectable in either whitefly species at any sampling time. The PNHD mutant was acquired and circulated in both whitefly species for up to 10 days, like the wt virus, while PNHE circulated in B. tabaci only. Using immunogold labeling, both PNHD and PNHE CPs were detected in B. tabaci salivary glands (SGs) like the wt virus, while no labeling was found in any whitefly tissue with the QDQD mutant. Significant inhibition of transmission of the wt virus was observed after prior feeding of the insects on plants infected with the PNHE mutant, but not on plants infected with the other mutants.

Like most plant viruses, geminiviruses are targeted by RNA silencing and encode suppressor proteins such as AL2 and L2 to counter this defense. These related proteins can suppress silencing by multiple mechanisms, one of which involves interacting with and inhibiting adenosine kinase (ADK), a cellular enzyme associated with the methyl cycle that generates S-adenosyl-methionine, an essential methyltransferase cofactor. Thus, we hypothesized that the viral genome is targeted by small-RNA-directed methylation. Here, we show that Arabidopsis plants with mutations in genes encoding cytosine or histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferases, RNA-directed methylation pathway components, or ADK are hypersensitive to geminivirus infection. We also demonstrate that viral DNA and associated histone H3 are methylated in infected plants and that cytosine methylation levels are significantly reduced in viral DNA isolated from methylation-deficient mutants. Finally, we demonstrate that Beet curly top virus L2(-) mutant DNA present in tissues that have recovered from infection is hypermethylated and that host recovery requires AGO4, a component of the RNA-directed methylation pathway. We propose that plants use chromatin methylation as a defense against DNA viruses, which geminiviruses counter by inhibiting global methylation. In addition, our results establish that geminiviruses can be useful models for genome methylation in plants and suggest that there are redundant pathways leading to cytosine methylation.",2008,8997-9007,18,82,,1996,"Pico, B; Diez, M J; Nuez, F",Viral diseases causing the greatest economic losses to the tomato crop .2.

Women are responsible for most of the cassava-related labor. Decisions about small-scale daily harvest, processing and sales, are an exception; these decisions are generally made by women. Biotechnological research for villagers in this region can focus in the short term on microbial biotechnologies for faster, safer, more nutritious cassava products; and on exploring the feasibility of micropropagation for increasing initial planting material of desirable cultivars. In the medium term, transgenic experimental genotypes may permit study of cyanogenesis and its relationship to cassava productivity, plant defense and processing quality; postharvest deterioration and its effects on women's activities; and altered root protein or vitamin content.

However, it is currently unknown how specific these MP-CP interactions are, nor how disruption of these interactions might impact on virus viability. Results: Using chimaeric genomes of two strains of Maize streak virus (MSV) we adopted a genetic approach to investigate the gross biological effects of interfering with interactions between virus MP and CP homologues derived from genetically distinct MSV isolates. MP and CP genes were reciprocally exchanged, individually and in pairs, between maize (MSV-Kom)-and Setaria sp. (MSV-Set)-adapted isolates sharing 78% genome-wide sequence identity. All chimaeras were infectious in Zea mays c. v. Jubilee and were characterized in terms of symptomatology and infection efficiency. Compared with their parental viruses, all the chimaeras were attenuated in symptom severity, infection efficiency, and the rate at which symptoms appeared. The exchange of individual MP and CP genes resulted in lower infection efficiency and reduced symptom severity in comparison with exchanges of matched MP-CP pairs.

The study was conducted in south-eastern Madagascar in a steep transition zone along an altitudinal and a sharp precipitation gradient between a high altitude rainforest and a lowland dry tropical forest. The restoration of gaps created by abandoned fields in this narrow, winding corridor could be essential to maintain connectivity between two areas (areas 1 and 2) of Andohahela National Park. Prior to implementing restoration, baseline ecological information is needed on the reference ecosystem and vegetation resilience must be studied to identify restoration needs. This study aims to (1) assess whether cultivation practices (irrigated rice vs. cassava, maize and sweet potato) influence vegetation dynamics after abandonment; (2) study vegetation dynamics and soils over time since abandonment, and (3) compare secondary forest vegetation and soils with those of mature forest patches. Surveys of vegetation and soil were conducted in 26 secondary forest patches abandoned from 3 to >25 years (synchronic approach) and in 19 adjacent mature forest patches (controls). No relationship between age of abandonment and vegetation species richness, composition or structure was found, but clear differences were detected between secondary and mature forest patches. Secondary forests are not colonized by species from mature forests, but instead their vegetation dynamics appear to lead to the establishment of thorny thickets dominated by Mimosa delicatula, which is absent from the mature forest. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2012,01-Aug,,159,,2013,"Tyska, D; Mallmann, C A; Corrêia, V; Tamiosso, C D; Mallmann, A O; Neto, J R",Vegetable protein concentrates in the diet of South American catfish Rhamdia quelen,Ciencia Rural,10.1590/S0103-84782013000700017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880069514&doi=10.1590%2FS0103-84782013000700017&partnerID=40&md5=24fc65043c8a7686ad2940e3b6d07985,"The aim of this study was to evaluate vegetable protein concentrates to replace soybean meal (traditional protein) on performance and chemical composition of catfish (Rhamdia quelen) and its influence on the coloration of the fillets.

The actuation behavior of dielectric elastomer under an applied electric field is predicted by Maxwell's pressure and thickness strain equations. According to these equations, the best electromechanical response is achieved when the relative permittivity is high and elastic modulus is low. The potential source for additives increasing the relative permittivity of rubbers can be vegetable powders that have much higher dielectric constant than common elastomers. In the present research, the dielectric and actuation properties of polyacrylate rubber (ACM) were studied after the addition of different vegetable-based fillers such as potato starch, corn starch, garlic, and paprika. The results were compared to ACM filled with barium titanate. The compounds containing vegetable fillers showed higher relative dielectric permittivity at 1 Hz frequency than the compounds containing barium titanate due to higher interfacial polarization. The actuation studies showed that lower electric fields are required to generate certain actuation forces when the starches and garlic are used in the rubber instead of barium titanate. Therefore, the vegetable-based fillers can be used to improve actuation performance of DEAs. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

In the daily diet, they have been strongly associated with improvement of gastrointestinal health, good vision, and reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, chronic diseases such as diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Some phytochemicals of vegetables are strong antioxidants and are thought to reduce the risk of chronic disease by protecting against free radical damage by modifying metabolic activation and detoxification of carcinogens or even by influencing processes that alter the course of tumor cells. Nutrition is both a quantity and a quality issue, and vegetables in all their many forms ensure an adequate intake of most vitamins and nutrients, dietary fibers, and phytochemicals, which can bring a much-needed measure of balance back to diets contributing to solve many of these nutrition problems. Plant breeders play a key role in determining what we eat, since every vegetable cultivar that we see on the market has benefited from plant breeding. The general objectives for producers are good yield, disease and pest resistance, uniformity, and abiotic stress resistance. Objectives for consumers are quality, appearance, shelf life, taste, and nutritional value. Quality in vegetable crops, in contrast to field crops, is often more important than yield. For producers to survive, market must accept cultivars. Thus, color, appearance, taste, and shape are usually more important than productivity. Vegetable breeding must include improving nutrition values because they are very important for human health. Historically, vegetable breeders have applied selection pressure to traits related to agronomic performance, particularly yield and quality, because these are the traits important to the producers. Growers have seldom been recompensed for nutritional factors, so there have been no economic incentives to provide significant attention to these traits. However, consumers are becoming more aware of these traits, and selecting for nutrient-rich vegetable cultivars is becoming part of nutrition-oriented vegetable breeding programs. Successes in vegetable breeding for higher vitamin and mineral content should consider not only substance concentration but also organic components in plants that can either reduce or increase bioavailability. Enhanced nutritional content would add value for poor, malnourished populations. Transgenic crops, commonly referred to as genetically modified (GM) crops, enable plant breeders to bring favorable genes, often previously inaccessible, into already elite cultivars, improving their value considerably and offering unique opportunities for controlling insects, viruses and other pathogens, as well as nutritional quality. Conventional plant breeding that utilizes non-transgenic approaches will remain the backbone of vegetable genetic improvement strategies. However, transgenic crop cultivars should not be excluded as products capable of contributing to more nutritious and healthy food. Many vegetable crops have been genetically modified to include improved features, such as higher nutritional status, better flavour, and reduced bitterness or can be used for vaccine delivery. Consumers could benefit further from eating more nutritious transgenic vegetables, e.g., an increase of crop carotenoids by metabolic sink manipulation through genetic engineering appears feasible in some vegetables. Genetically engineering carrots containing increased calcium (Ca) levels may boost Ca uptake, thereby reducing the incidence of Ca deficiencies such as osteoporosis. Fortified transgenic lettuce with zinc will overcome its deficiency that severely impairs organ function. Transgenic lettuce with improve tocopherol, and resveratrol composition may prevent coronary disease and arteriosclerosis and can contribute to cancer chemopreventative activity. Folates deficiency, which is regarded as a global health problem, can also be overcome with transgenic tomatoes with folate levels that provide a complete adult daily requirement. Food safety and health benefits can also be enhanced through transgenic approaches, e.g., resource-poor people in rural Asia and Africa will benefit eating cyanide-free cultivars of cassava. Biotechnology-derived vegetable crops will succeed if clear advantages and safety are demonstrated to both growers and consumers. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Cassava exhibits genotypic variation in terms of its performance under limited water supply in the soil. With reference to the well-watered plants, the results generally showed that leafdrooping, leaf senescence, leaf fall and reduction in plant height, number of fully developed leaves, leaf and total plant dry weights were associated with water deficit; their magnitude being variable depending on the variety and time after the imposition of drought. The predawn and midday leaf water potentials, and midday transpiration rate of droughted plants, irrespective of variety, were suppressed. A highly marked increase in stomatal resistance was generally observed in response to drought. Traits such as high stomatal resistance, high leaf water potentials, high water use efficiency, high biomass, low transpiration rate, and low leaf fall were customarily manifested by the varieties that were observed to perform better under deficient soil moisture than the other varieties.
